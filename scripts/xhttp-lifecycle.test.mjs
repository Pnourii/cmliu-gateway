// Reported symptom: the tunnel feels unstable with connection drops, most often in XHTTP.
// Two XHTTP-specific lifecycle defects explain exactly that, and both were reproduced by external review:
//
//   1. A post-authentication failure (dial refused, upstream reset, write failure) called the bridge's
//      GRACEFUL close, which ends the already-sent HTTP 200 with a clean EOF. The client sees a
//      successful — usually empty — response, so it neither retries nor reports an error. To a user that
//      is a page that silently fails or a connection that "drops".
//   2. UDP/DNS mode has no remote read pipe to end the downstream, and the upstream-close block was
//      gated on `!首包.isUDP`. So a finite DNS request delivered its answer and then left the response
//      stream open until the client timed out.
//
// These assertions are structural because driving the real ReadableStream needs the Workers runtime;
// what they pin is that the two paths are DISTINCT and that the failure path errors rather than closes.
